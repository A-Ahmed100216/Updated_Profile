                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>A recent graduate with a 1:1 in a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering. Despite the unconventional background, I have found that my degree has cultivated a set of transferrable skills which can be applied in any environment. More-so, I am a highly driven and ambitious individual with a disciplined mindset. I find this gives me the ability to adapt to change quickly. I am an avid believer that one never stops learning, there is always room for improvement. This is reflected in my actions after university wherein I spent the summer attending the IN4.0 Talent Academy. During my time, I was briefly introduced to an array of industry 4.0 technologies including cloud computing and the Internet of Things. This was pivotal in gaining a keen interest in emerging technologies, particularly in their use for the enhancement of everyday life. It is for this reason; I would like to pursue a career in a pioneering company which challenges the status quo.

                                <p>A culmination of the skills and topics covered in the first few weeks of the academy. This entailed Python, SQL, Agile, and presentation skills. A set of user stories were assigned and each team was tasked with creating an airport booking system. Python was applied to build the foundational structure of the code. This entailed the use of object-oriented programming to create classes for various aspects specified within the user stories. Python was also used to run SQL commands in order to create, update and query databases. Agile methodology was adopted to plan and manage the project, with scrum being selected as the framework. The role of scrum master was rotated through the course of the project in order to allow all team members to gain experience. The culmination of the project was a presentation and code demonstration to our peers.

                                <p>A sample node app was provided as a basis upon which I could build upon and implement DevOps principles such as continuous integration, delivery and deployment. This commenced with the use of vagrant to run a virtual machine and deploy the app on the local host. Incrementing upon this, Jenkins was applied to build a continuous integration pipeline which would trigger builds and send notifications to Microsoft Teams. Further increments were applied to build the continuous deployment pipeline. Following on from this, AWS was used to deploy the app to the cloud in a virtual private cloud. The final increment thus far, was to automate deployment using a configuration management tool such as Ansible wherein playbooks were written in order to provision and run the app.</p>

                                <p>Collated the topics covered throughout the academy to produce an end-to-end automated pipeline for a webscraper app. Tasks were delegated between three teams, front-end, back-end, and ci/cd. I was part of the back-end team responsible for utilising MVC with flask. MVC is a software design approach which organises code into 3 categories, model, view, and controller. The controller receives requests from a user, the model collates the code required to reposed the users request and passes to the view which renders a webpage. The back-end team were responsible for implementing flask, a web development framework, and coordinating with the front-end to produce a webpage for the app. The other main objective was to read and write data to an Amazon S3 bucket. This entailed creating a Python script which utilised the Amazon Command Line interface. Upon doing so, a Dockerfile was created to build an image and push to DockerHub for the ci/cd team to use.  </p>

The latter included learning the various aspects of scrum such as roles, ceremonies, and artifacts.
                                <br><strong>SQL</strong> – Used Microsoft Azure to implement SQL theory. This entailed the use of data definition and data manipulation language to create and update databases. Following on from this, data query language was applied in order to query data from the default Northwind database.
                                <br><strong>Python</strong> – In-depth coverage of topics ranging from basic of python including types and operators to control flow. Subsequently moved onto Object Oriented Programming, covering the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming, and seeking to apply these to forthcoming tasks.
                                <br><strong>Vagrant</strong> – Covered topic of virtualization and utilized vagrant to create virtual machines within which a sample node app was deployed.
                                <br><strong>Jenkins</strong> -  Introduced to Jenkins and its capabilities in continuous integration, delivery and deployment. Used Jenkins to increment upon the work conducted thus far. This involved building a CI pipeline for the sample node app and configuring builds to be triggered via commits pushed to GitHub. Subsequently, build notifications were sent to Microsoft Teams.
                                <br><strong>AWS</strong> – This commenced with an overview of AWS, the services it provides and the advantages of using cloud over on-premise solutions. Introduced to EC2, an AWS compute service which allows virtual machines to be provisioned in the cloud. Launched instances to deploy the sample app. Subsequently, moved onto networking with AWS which included topics such as Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) , Internet Gateways, and Bastion Servers. This was applied to launch new instances with security at the forefront.
                                <br><strong>Ansible</strong> – Commenced with an introduction to infrastructure as code (IAC),  before moving onto Ansible, its uses, and key components. Installed Ansible on an instance and wrote playbooks to automate the configuration process of deploying the sample app.
                                <br><strong>Terraform</strong> – Introduced to Terraform which is a tool used for orchestration configuration. Utilised Terraform for orchestration of instances, security groups, subnets and various other resources to configure consistent infrastructure.
